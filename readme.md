## Engine Design

### OpenGL Wrapper

I will implement a wrapper for opengl functions to make them more "rusty".

##### Shaders

Shaders should be loadable easily with a single path.

### ECS (entity component system)

Using legion-ecs.

### Math

I will be using nalgebra instead of cgmath.

##### Components

-   Transform  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transform holds position, rotation and scale.
